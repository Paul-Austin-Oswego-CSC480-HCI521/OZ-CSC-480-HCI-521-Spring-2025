### Development Environment Setup

0. Make sure you have `java jdk17` and `docker` installed.
1. Clone the repo using `git clone`, and `cd` into the project
2. Create a new file in the root directory of the project called `.env`, and fill out the following:

```.env
# Create a google API client: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# Then fill out the following variables to match your credentials
CLIENT_ID=
CLIENT_SECRET=
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:9081/users/auth/callback # <-- default

# The URL to the backend proxy service that is running
VITE_PROXY_URL=http://localhost:9083 # <-- default

 # Add the following service URLs used by the backend
 USER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:9081
 QUOTE_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:9082
```

To start the whole stack, run the following command in the root directory:

```
docker compose up
```

### Developing the Frontend

Use these steps if you want a quick way to test your changes while building the frontend. **Make sure you've followed the steps above before continuing.**

1. Edit the docker compose file to prevent the compose stack from running the frontend container:

```diff
services:
-  frontend:
-    build: ./frontend/src/main/frontend
-    ports:
-      - 9080:80
+  # frontend:
+  #   build: ./frontend/src/main/frontend
+  #   ports:
+  #     - 9080:80
```

```diff
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: nginx-proxy
    ports:
      - "9083:80"
    volumes:
      - ./proxy/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
    depends_on:
-     - frontend
+   # - frontend
      - user-service
      - quotes-service
```

2. Edit the proxy configuration so it no longer depends on the frontend running

```diff
    location / {
-   proxy_pass http://frontend/;
+   proxy_pass http://localhost:9080/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;

    proxy_set_header Host $host;
```

3. `cd` into `frontend/src/main/frontend`
4. Make sure the dependencies are up to date by running `npm install`
5. Run the dev server by using `npm run dev`

### Developing the Backend

After making your changes to the code, restart the microservices by running the following:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up --build
```
